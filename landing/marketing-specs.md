FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q: How is this different from other productivity apps?
A: LifeBuffer focuses specifically on tracking and reporting accomplishments, not managing tasks or projects. It's designed for professionals who need to remember and communicate what they've done, not plan what to do next.

Q: Do I need to track everything?
A: Not at all. LifeBuffer works with whatever level of tracking fits your life. Some users log 2-3 major activities per day, others capture everything. The AI adapts to your patterns.

Q: How accurate is the voice recognition?
A: Very accurate for normal speech patterns. The AI also learns your vocabulary and commonly used terms, improving accuracy over time.

Q: Can I use this for personal life tracking too?
A: Absolutely. While LifeBuffer has a professional focus, the flexible context system works perfectly for personal goals, health tracking, hobbies, and life activities.

Q: What happens to my data if I cancel?
A: You can export everything in multiple formats. Your data is always yours - LifeBuffer just helps you organize and recall it better.

Q: Is my voice data stored?
A: Voice recordings are processed for transcription only and then deleted. We store the resulting text, not the audio.

Q: How does the AI categorization work?
A: The AI suggests contexts based on keywords, patterns in your historical data, and common professional activity types. You always have final control over categorization.
